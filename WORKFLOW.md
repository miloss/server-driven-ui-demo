3. **Custom changes** - error fixes, file renaming, thorough code review

### üîé Research phase

Tool selection based on:
- **Requirements**: React, TypeScript, Next.js

- Defined code styling and library preferences

### üßë‚Äçüíª Manual refinements

Manual changes included:
- Bug fixes and adjustments
- Code reorganisation and directory structure
- Significant refactoring tasks delegated to Claude
- Styling stripped to minimum to keep UI clean
- Complete codebase review and validation

## Development environment setup

- Node.js 18+ with npm
- Git for version control
- Visual Studio Code with Github Copilot
